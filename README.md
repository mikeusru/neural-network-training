# Training with Neural Networks

This is a follow-up to a previous set of tutorials which you can find here: https://github.com/mikeusru/scikit-learn-training

Here you'll find a collection of follow-along files for working with neural networks using tensorflow and keras, all of which run in google colaboratory. These files are created by me, Michael Smirnov, and much of the content is based on the book "Hands-on machine learning with scikit-learn, Keras, and Tensorflow"
